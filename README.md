I can't tell you how many times I read a resum√© and somewhere in there find a link to their GitHub account. This sounds great in theory. What usually happens is this: I arrive at their GitHub. They have 158 repositories for every single little piece of project work they did in bootcamp or university and I have no clue what I'm supposed to be looking at!

You can star some repos, create really great readme's to explain why this repository is important. What am I looking for? Did you come up with a novel solution to a specific situation? Did you learn something really important while working on it? Did you create an awesome looking interface? Toss in some screenshots! Maybe even a GIF showing off some functionality! Make it easier for me to know why I'm looking at this.
